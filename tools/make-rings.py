"""Generate a set of head sizing rings as binary STLs.

You try them on and the one that just fits tells you your size. That number is
what a helmet or a hat model wants from you, and it beats a tape measure held
by yourself in a mirror, which is how most people get it wrong.

The cross section is not a circle. Heads are ovals, flatter at the forehead
than at the back, so a circular ring lies to you: it binds at the temples and
gapes front to back. These use the same superellipse Headfit builds its heads
from, with the same exponents, so a ring that fits means the number it carries
is the number to type into the tool.

Each ring is labelled on its top face, because an unlabelled set of rings is a
bag of identical rings within about a day. Digits are raised on a pad at the
front, printed flat with no supports.

# itself to the plate over 2200 mm2 and all of that has to let go through the
# single point a scraper gets under. The first one printed snapped on removal.
# Chamfering takes the contact strip from 3.0 mm to 1.4 mm, a little over half

# forehead before the wall did and every ring read small at the front. Ramped
# in and out over PAD_RAMP rather than butted on, because a stiff block on a
# thin band puts the whole bending load into the two joints, and the first one
# printed broke at exactly that line taking it off the plate.
